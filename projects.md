# Personal Projects

Here are some of the coding projects I've worked on in my free time:

- **Youtube Downloader App**: I developed a youtube video downloader using C#, WPF, and playwright, with a wonky method that I discovered
- [Github]([https://github.com/pickles33](https://github.com/pickles33/YDC)).
- **School Forum Website Project**: I collaborated in a 4 person team to create a school forum with many functionalities. Used Django Framework
- [Github](https://github.com/WilsonMarquis/CareerManagementSystem).
- **Personal Website**: Here's the repo for this website. I created this very simply using github copilot and markdown files.

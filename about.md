# About Me

I'm Stephen Lee.  
This is a brief introduction about myself, my background, and my interests.

Growing up I've always loved technology, whether it be videogames, computers, or the internet.
I studied Computer Science at Columbus State University, where I graduated with a Bachelors in August 2022.
I am currently looking for work in I.T or any related field in Computer Science.

My last role was working at HSAGP (Hyundai SK America Green Power) as an IT technician. I was responsible mainly for flashing software on office computers
and for the factory itself. I helped with general tech support across all departments with problems ranging from network issues to hardware.

Through this experience I learned alot about I.T in general and also about working in a Korean company, which was a very unique experience.

I also used this time at this job to better myself as a person,
I lost over 100 pounds in the span of my time working there (6 months). Here is a picture of me then and me now. 250 pounds -> 150 pounds.

I believe in hard work to achieve goals and I am always looking to improve my life, I approach my work the same way. 

I take pride in my work and I wish to showcase my abilities
